## Navigating the Project

The project is organized into several key directories and files to help you understand its structure and functionality:

- **lib/**: This directory contains the main Dart code for the application. You will find the main entry point in `main.dart`, along with various screens and widgets organized in subdirectories.
  
- **assets/**: This folder holds all the static assets such as images, fonts, and other resources used in the application. Make sure to reference these assets correctly in your code.

- **test/**: This directory is where you can find the unit and widget tests for the application. It is important to write tests to ensure the reliability of your code.

- **pubspec.yaml**: This file manages the dependencies for your Flutter project. You can add or update packages here as needed.

- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and other relevant information.

To navigate the project effectively, familiarize yourself with these directories and files. You can use your IDE's file explorer to quickly access different parts of the project.
